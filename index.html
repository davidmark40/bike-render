                <h4>Tips for Maximizing Coins:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Avoid crashing to secure the maximum payout.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on completing missions efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Replay earlier levels to improve your score.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. In-App Purchases</h3>
                <p>If grinding isn‚Äôt your thing, you can always spend real money to buy coins or unlock bikes directly. But let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî where‚Äôs the fun in that?</p>
            </section>

            <section class="shortcuts">
                <h2>The Shortcut to Unlocking All Bikes</h2>
                <p>Now, here‚Äôs the part you‚Äôve been waiting for: How to unlock all the bikes without spending endless hours grinding or shelling out your hard-earned cash. While the traditional methods above are great, there are some shortcuts you can use to speed up the process.</p>

                <h3>1. Modify Game Files (APK Mods)</h3>
                <p>Many players turn to modified APKs (Android Package Kits) that allow you to unlock all bikes instantly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Instant access to all bikes and unlimited coins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using modded APKs can get your account banned.</li>
                        <li>It‚Äôs risky, as you might download malware instead of the actual game.</li>
                        <li>You miss out on the fun and challenge of unlocking bikes the "honest" way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Watch Ads (Yes, Really)</h3>
                <p>Traffic Rider offers free coins in exchange for watching ads. Sure, it‚Äôs not glamorous, but it‚Äôs a legit way to earn extra cash without spending real money.<br><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Stack up your ad bonuses during a Netflix binge session. Multitasking for the win!</p>

                <h3>3. Daily Bonuses and Rewards</h3>
                <p>Log in every day to collect free rewards. It‚Äôs like a piggy bank ‚Äî slow but steady progress!</p>

                <h3>4. Third-Party Coin Generators (Use Caution)</h3>
                <p>Some websites claim to generate unlimited coins for you. Proceed with caution, as most of these are scams designed to steal your personal information.</p>
